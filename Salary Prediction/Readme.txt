1. How do I use my simple linear regression model to make a single prediction, for example, to predict the salary of an employee with 12 years of experience?
Ans:
This model predicts that the salary of an employee with 12 years of experience is $ 138967,5.

2. How do I get the final regression equation y = b0 + b1 x with the final values of the coefficients b0 and b1?
Ans:
Here, the equation of our simple linear regression model is:

Salary=9345.94Ã—YearsExperience+26816.19
